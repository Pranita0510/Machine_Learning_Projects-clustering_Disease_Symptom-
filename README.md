**Disease Symptom Clustering System:**

**Using this link, we can access Disease_Symptom app:- https://diseasesymptom.vercel.app/**

This project presents an intelligent clustering-based approach to analyzing and understanding disease symptoms using **unsupervised machine learning**. Designed as part of a medical support system, this model identifies **hidden patterns** among symptoms that may indicate similar or related diseases—empowering early diagnosis, enhancing decision-making, and reducing diagnostic time in real-world healthcare systems.

📁 Included File:

* `implementation.ipynb`: The complete Jupyter Notebook that walks through data preprocessing, symptom encoding, model training (K-Means), and visualization of clustered results.

---

📊 Dataset Information:

**Dataset Name**: `Symptom-severity.csv`

**Description**: A structured dataset containing over **130+ symptoms** mapped with corresponding **severity weights (1–5)**. This enables conversion of text-based medical symptom data into numerical form suitable for clustering.

 **Application**: Used to simulate real-world patient symptom scenarios for modeling unsupervised clustering behavior.

---

🚀 Key Highlights:

✅ **Symptom Encoding** – Transforms categorical symptom names into numerical values based on severity.

✅ **Data Normalization** – Ensures uniformity in symptom weight scales for accurate clustering.

✅ **K-Means Clustering** – Groups symptom sets into disease-relevant clusters using Scikit-learn.

✅ **Elbow Method** – Determines the optimal number of clusters (k) based on distortion scores.

✅ **Cluster Visualization** – Leverages Matplotlib and Seaborn to present intuitive cluster insights.

* Pandas, NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Seaborn & Matplotlib
* Jupyter Notebook

---

**🎯 Project Goal:**

To build an intelligent backend model capable of understanding and grouping medical symptoms without prior labels. This can serve as the **foundation for a disease prediction system**, **medical chatbot**, or **clinical support engine**—helping doctors and patients get closer to a probable diagnosis even in ambiguous scenarios.
